# Market-Sentiment-Analysis
15-112 Term Project
Project: Market Sentiment Simulation
Name: Keonwoo Park

Description: This project allows users to view a stock's past trading history as well as the top news headlines associated with the stock. These headlines are analyzed through NLTK for positive or negative sentiment. Through the quantitative sentiment, a buy, hold, or sell rating is attached to the stock. The user can then choose to buy the stock and add it to his or her portfolio, where they begin with $100,000 in simulated cash. All stock prices, news headlines, and portfolio returns are live and accurate of real-time markets. Furthermore, multiple users can use this simulation through a log-in process where their data is saved.

How to Run: tp1.py is the file that should be fun in the editor. The project does use a couple gif images, but these are provided in the zipped folder.

Libraries: 
- alpha_vantage
- requests
- json
- matplotlib
- nltk
- vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment

Shortcuts: A shortcut/help menu is provided in the project user window for easier guidance.
